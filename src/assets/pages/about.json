    "Content": "In 1996 I started a new job with the Trussville Police Department. I had worked since 1987 for Birmingham and Leeds police departments. When I first began patrolling in Trussville, I fell in love with the Sherman Oaks subdivision. It has a beautiful entrance, it's centrally located and has direct access to the Sports Complex with parks and trails. The houses are all beautiful and the streets are quiet. I had the privilege to sell one recently and the new owners love the neighborhood as much as I do!"
